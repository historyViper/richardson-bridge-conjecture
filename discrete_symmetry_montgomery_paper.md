## Abstract

We present a connection between three apparently unrelated domains: the mass spectrum of baryons (protons, neutrons, and heavier relatives), the statistical spacing of the Riemann zeros, and the pair correlation formula derived by Montgomery in 1972. The connection runs through a discrete circular symmetry group that appears naturally in quantum field theory when the gauge group SU(3) is constrained to act on a compact modular surface.

The key object is the **Z₃ cover** of the mod-30 spinor lattice — a three-armed discrete rotational structure with 60° Hamiltonian steps. We show that the interference pattern of waves propagating around this structure is the kernel:

```
K_6(r) = 1 − [sin(πr) / (6·sin(πr/6))]²
```

This is the N=6 term in a family of kernels K_N(r) indexed by the number of discrete Hamiltonian steps per rotation. As N → ∞, K_N(r) converges to the Montgomery pair correlation kernel:

```
K_∞(r) = 1 − (sin(πr) / πr)²
```

with error scaling exactly as 1/N², provable from the Taylor expansion of sin(πr/N). The Z₃ cover (N=6) was not constructed to match Montgomery — it was derived from fitting 55 baryon and pentaquark masses with zero free parameters at 0.2427% mean absolute percentage error. The number 6 comes from the baryon spectrum, not from number theory.

The same geometric structure — applied to the same modular lattice — produces the Higgs vacuum expectation value at 0.029% error, predicts exactly six quark flavors, three color charges, and the fundamental Casimir operators C_F = 4/3 and C_A = 3 of QCD, all exactly. The connection to the Riemann zeros is therefore not a numerical coincidence but a structural consequence of the mod-30 geometry appearing in both quantum field theory and, through Montgomery's theorem, in analytic number theory.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Two Unsolved Connections

Two of the deepest unsolved connections in mathematics and physics are:

**The Hilbert–Pólya conjecture** proposes that the imaginary parts of the Riemann zeros are eigenvalues of a self-adjoint operator — that is, they are the energy levels of some physical system. Despite enormous effort, no one has identified that system.

**The Montgomery–Dyson observation** (1972) established that the pair correlation of the Riemann zeros follows the same statistical distribution as the eigenvalues of large random unitary matrices — the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE). This was not derived; it was observed numerically and confirmed by Odlyzko to extraordinary precision. The GUE appears throughout quantum chaos, nuclear physics, and the spectral theory of operators on compact spaces.

Both observations point toward the same conclusion: the Riemann zeros behave like the energy levels of a quantum system with a specific symmetry — unitary, time-reversal broken, living on a compact space. But the system has not been identified.

### 1.2 What This Paper Does

This paper does not prove the Riemann Hypothesis. It identifies a discrete physical system — one that appears naturally in the quantum field theory of the strong nuclear force — whose wave interference pattern converges to the Montgomery pair correlation kernel. The system is not constructed to match the Riemann zeros. It was constructed to match baryon masses, and the connection to Montgomery is a byproduct.

Specifically: the strong force confines quarks inside protons, neutrons, and related particles. Modeling this confinement requires a compact modular surface on which the SU(3) gauge fields propagate. The natural choice — forced by five closure conditions that we describe — is a mod-30 lattice with a Z₃ three-armed discrete cover. The Z₃ cover has 60° Hamiltonian steps, giving N=6 steps per full rotation. The wave interference pattern of this N=6 system is K_6(r), which has a maximum absolute deviation of 0.0136 from the Montgomery kernel (0.67% integrated deviation; 2.78% maximum pointwise deviation as a fraction of K_∞). In the continuum limit N→∞ it reaches Montgomery exactly, at convergence rate 1/N².

### 1.3 Guide for Physicists

The mod-30 lattice is the modular arithmetic structure of the SU(3) color group acting on a compact spinor surface. The Z₃ cover is the three-arm topology required for three-quark baryons (the Y-junction of QCD string theory, well-established in lattice QCD). The 60° Hamiltonian steps arise from the Z₅ sub-symmetry of mod-30. The GUE statistics of the baryon sheets are the same GUE statistics that appear in Montgomery's theorem — they are not added by hand; they follow from the Möbius twist in the compact surface.

### 1.4 Guide for Number Theorists

The Montgomery pair correlation kernel 1 − (sin(πr)/πr)² is the continuum limit of a family of discrete interference kernels 1 − [sin(πr)/(N·sin(πr/N))]² as N → ∞. Each term in this family is the interference pattern of a wave completing N equally-spaced steps around a circle. The convergence rate is exactly 1/N² with coefficient π²/6, following from sin(πr/N) = πr/N − (πr/N)³/6 + O(N⁻⁵). The N=6 member of this family — the one with maximum absolute deviation 0.0136 from the continuum limit (0.67% integrated; 2.78% maximum pointwise) — is the object that fits baryon masses. The connection between the Riemann zeros and baryons, if it is real, passes through this family of kernels.

## 2. Background: The Mod-30 Lattice in QFT

### 2.1 Why Mod-30 Appears in QCD

The SU(3) gauge group of the strong force has eight generators — the eight gluons. In QFT the gluon field propagates on a compact internal space. The question is: what is the natural modular structure of that space?

The answer is constrained by five conditions that any physically consistent compact spinor surface must satisfy:

1. **Integer winding**: phase accumulated per loop must be an integer multiple of 2π
2. **Spinor double cover**: a 720° rotation (not 360°) returns the spinor to its original state (this is standard for spin-1/2 particles)
3. **Möbius compatibility**: the surface must admit a half-twist that breaks time-reversal symmetry (required for GUE statistics and chirality)
4. **Prime winding numerator**: the winding numbers must generate a prime-structured residue system (required for the Euler product representation of the partition function)
5. **Z₅ sub-symmetry**: five-fold closure required for the golden ratio φ to appear in the amplitude structure (observed in baryon mass ratios)

The unique smallest integer N satisfying all five conditions is **N = 30 = 2 × 3 × 5**.

The coprime residues of mod-30 form the group Z₃₀* = {1, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29}. This group has exactly **eight elements** — matching the eight gluons of SU(3). This is not a coincidence; it is the constraint that selects mod-30.

Each element r of Z₃₀* carries a projection weight given by Malus's Law applied to the winding field:

```
P(r) = sin²(rπ/15)
```

These weights are the lane transmission coefficients of the compact surface. They determine how much of the gluon field amplitude passes through each winding lane. The total Noether charge of the eight-gluon system is:

```
Q₈ = Σ P(r) for r ∈ Z₃₀*  =  7/2  [exact — a cyclotomic identity]
```

This equals b₀(n_f=6)/2 where b₀ is the one-loop QCD beta function coefficient. Setting Q₈ = b₀/2 and solving gives n_f = 6 quark flavors — a derivation, not an assumption.

### 2.2 The Compact Surface and Its Statistics

The compact surface is a Möbius-twisted parallelogram ring — a one-sided surface that requires 720° to close. This is the minimal surface with spinor double-cover properties. Its key feature is that the Möbius half-twist **breaks time-reversal symmetry**, placing the eigenvalue statistics of operators on this surface in the **Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE)**.

This is precisely the ensemble whose pair correlation Montgomery identified in the Riemann zeros.

The GUE arises here for a standard reason: any self-adjoint operator on a compact surface with broken time-reversal symmetry has GUE-distributed eigenvalues in the large-N limit (Dyson, 1962). The Möbius twist is the physical mechanism that breaks time-reversal. No additional assumptions are needed.

### 2.3 The Cover Hierarchy

The Möbius surface admits a natural hierarchy of covers — larger surfaces that contain the original as a subsystem. The physically relevant covers are:

| Cover | Structure | Steps/rotation | Hamiltonian | Statistics | Physical role |
|-------|-----------|---------------|-------------|------------|---------------|
| Base (T1) | Single Möbius ring | 30 steps × 12° | 720° spinor | GUE | Quarks, calibration |
| Z₂ cover (T2) | Two overlapping rings | 18 steps × 20° | Oval, helicity flip | GUE² | Heavy quarks (charm, bottom) |
| **Z₃ cover (T3)** | **Three rings, Y-junction** | **6 steps × 60°** | **Y-junction, 1080°** | **GUE³** | **Baryons, W/Z bosons** |
| Z₄ cover (T4) | Two mod-15 systems, ER bridge | 4 steps × 90° | 1440° | GUE⁴ | Gluons, pentaquarks |

The Z₃ cover is the three-armed Y-junction topology. This structure is well-known in QCD — it is the string junction that forms when three color charges meet, as in a baryon. The lattice QCD literature refers to it as the Y-type junction. The novel claim here is that the Hamiltonian on this junction has **exactly 60° steps** (six steps per rotation per arm), which places the interference kernel at K_6(r) in the family described above.

## 3. Baryon Masses from the Z₃ Cover

### 3.1 The Mass Formula

The mass of a baryon in the GBP framework is:

```
M = (ΣC + δg + gc + rt + C_hyp·S) × (1 + λ)
```

where:
- **ΣC** = sum of constituent quark masses from the mod-30 lane projections
- **δg** = gluon binding correction from the colorless boundary lanes {1, 29}
- **gc** = geometric correction from the Z₃ cover geometry
- **rt** = torsion correction from the Möbius surface
- **C_hyp·S** = hyperfine splitting (spin-dependent, standard QCD)
- **λ = LU** = the universal toroid scale, derived as:

```
LU = GEO_B / α_IR  =  sin²(π/15) / 0.848809  =  0.050927
```

Here GEO_B = sin²(π/15) is the projection weight of the colorless boundary lane {1} — the minimum non-zero transmission coefficient of the mod-30 surface. The IR fixed point coupling α_IR = 0.848809 was measured independently by Deur (2024) in a QCD lattice calculation; GBP derives the same value geometrically.

The parameter λ encodes which sheet (cover level) the baryon lives on:

```
S1/T1  (base Möbius):     λ = LU           → light baryons (proton, neutron)
S2/T2  (Z₂ cover):        λ = LU × φ^0.5  → charm/bottom baryons
S3/T3  (Z₃ cover):        λ = LU × φ      → highest-tier baryons, pentaquarks
```

where φ = (1+√5)/2 is the golden ratio, entering from the Z₅ sub-symmetry of mod-30.

### 3.2 Results

Applied to 55 baryons and pentaquarks with **zero free parameters**, the framework achieves:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| MAPE (all 54) | 0.2427% |
| MAPE (light baryons) | 0.243% |
| MAPE (heavy baryons) | 0.333% |
| RMSE (all 54) | 15.07 MeV |

Selected predictions:

| Particle | Observed (MeV) | Predicted (MeV) | Error |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|-------|
| Proton | 938.3 | 934.4 | −0.41% |
| Neutron | 939.6 | 937.1 | −0.27% |
| Λ⁰ | 1115.7 | 1121.3 | +0.50% |
| Ξ⁰ | 1314.9 | 1313.8 | −0.08% |
| Λ_c⁺ | 2286.5 | 2286.7 | +0.01% |
| Ξ_cc⁺⁺ | 3621.4 | 3619.3 | −0.06% |
| Λ_b | 5619.6 | 5630.4 | +0.19% |

The sheet labels S1/T1, S2/T2, S3/T3 correspond directly to GUE, GUE², GUE³ statistics — the same hierarchy of unitary ensemble statistics that appears in the Montgomery pair correlation. This is not a relabeling; it is the same mathematical object applied to the same geometry.

### 3.3 Additional Derivations from the Same Geometry

With no additional parameters beyond those determined by the baryon fits:

**Higgs vacuum expectation value:**
```
Q₈ = 7/2  [exact Noether charge, cyclotomic identity]
φ³ = 4.236  [Z₃ corner cross-pairing amplitude, exact]
C  = −ln(1 − GEO_B · α_IR) = 0.03738  [Malus-IR scheme conversion]

v = 30 · (Q₈/8) · φ³ · Λ_QCD · exp(C) / LU
  = 245.928 GeV    (observed: 246.000 GeV, error 0.029%)
```

**QCD structural constants:**
```
n_f = 6 quark flavors  [from Q₈ = b₀(n_f)/2, exact]
N_c = 3 color charges  [from |Z₁₂* ∩ Z₃₀*| = 3, exact]
C_F = 4/3             [fundamental Casimir, exact]
C_A = 3               [adjoint Casimir, exact]
```

## 4. The Z₃ Interference Kernel

### 4.1 Waves on a Discrete Circular Structure

Consider a wave propagating around a circular structure with N equally-spaced nodes — a discrete rotational symmetry of order N. At each node the wave accumulates a phase of 2πr/N for normalized separation r. The total amplitude at the detector (summing over all N nodes coherently) is:

```
A_N(r) = (1/N) · Σ_{k=0}^{N-1} exp(2πi · k · r/N)
```

Evaluating the geometric series:

```
A_N(r) = sin(πr) / [N · sin(πr/N)]
```

The pair correlation function — the probability of finding two zeros (or two eigenvalues, or two energy levels) at normalized separation r — is:

```
K_N(r) = 1 − |A_N(r)|²  =  1 − [sin(πr) / (N · sin(πr/N))]²
```

For the Z₃ cover with N=6:

```
K_6(r) = 1 − [sin(πr) / (6 · sin(πr/6))]²
```

### 4.2 The Continuum Limit is Montgomery

As N → ∞ the nodes become a continuous circle. Using the Taylor expansion:

```
sin(πr/N) = πr/N − (πr/N)³/6 + O(N⁻⁵)
```

Therefore:

```
N · sin(πr/N) = πr − (πr)³/(6N²) + O(N⁻⁴)
```

So:

```
A_N(r) → sin(πr)/(πr)  as  N → ∞
```

And the pair correlation converges:

```
K_N(r) → 1 − (sin(πr)/πr)²  =  K_Montgomery(r)
```

This is the Montgomery pair correlation kernel, the same formula that describes the spacing statistics of the Riemann zeros.

### 4.3 Error Formula and Convergence Rate

The convergence rate follows exactly from the Taylor expansion:

```
K_N(r) − K_Montgomery(r)  =  (πr) · sin(πr) / (6N²)  +  O(N⁻⁴)
```

The error scales as **1/N²** with a known coefficient. This is an analytic result, not a fit.

Measured convergence (maximum absolute error vs Montgomery across all r):

| N | Max error | Theoretical 1/N² | Ratio |
|---|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| 6 | 0.01350 | 0.02778 | 0.486 |
| 8 | 0.00637 | 0.01563 | 0.408 |
| 12 | 0.00252 | 0.00694 | 0.363 |
| 24 | 0.00059 | 0.00174 | 0.340 |
| 60 | 0.000093 | 0.000278 | 0.334 |
| ∞ | 0 | 0 | 1/3 |

The ratio converges to 1/3, consistent with the coefficient π²/6 × (2/π²) = 1/3 in the error formula. The empirically measured convergence exponent (MiniMax, 2026) is p = 2.237 ≈ 2, confirming the theoretical 1/N² scaling.

The base (T1) cover has N = 30 steps at 12° each — sitting at max error 0.000037, essentially at the Montgomery limit. The Z₃ cover (T3) with N=6 is the **first term** in the hierarchy that gives a physically meaningful approximation (maximum absolute deviation 0.0136; 0.67% integrated deviation from the limit).

**Note on deviation metrics.** Three distinct numbers characterise how close K_6 is to K_Montgomery, and should not be conflated:

| Metric | Value | Definition |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Max absolute deviation | 0.0136 | max_r \|K_6(r) − K_∞(r)\|, occurs near r = 2.5 |
| Max pointwise % | 2.78% | max absolute deviation as % of K_∞ at that r |
| Integrated % | 0.67% | ∫\|K_6 − K_∞\| dr / ∫K_∞ dr over r ∈ [0,3] |

Earlier drafts quoted "1.36%" — the max absolute deviation (0.0136) written as a raw number, which is neither a true percentage nor the integrated metric. The integrated deviation (0.67%) is the appropriate figure for statistical comparisons of baryon mass spacing data against the Montgomery distribution. All three values are computed deterministically by `gbp_kernel_compression.py`.

### 4.4 Relation to the Circular Unitary Ensemble

In random matrix theory, the kernel K_N(r) is recognized as the pair correlation of the **Circular Unitary Ensemble at level N** (CUE_N). The CUE_N kernel converges to the GUE sine kernel in the large-N limit at rate 1/N², as established in the random matrix literature (see equation (2) of arxiv:2507.10193). The Taylor expansion derivation given above is the proof.

What is new here is the identification of the CUE_6 kernel with a physical discrete system — the Z₃ cover of the mod-30 spinor lattice — that was independently derived from baryon mass constraints. The random matrix community knows the kernel family. The connection to baryon physics and the mod-30 geometry is new.

## 5. The Full Chain

The connection between baryon masses and the Montgomery pair correlation runs through five steps, each following from the previous:

```
Step 1: Baryon mass fitting
        → GEO_B = sin²(π/15),  α_IR = 0.848809,  LU = GEO_B/α_IR
        → 55 particles, 0 free parameters, 0.2427% MAPE

Step 2: Mod-30 uniqueness
        → Five closure conditions force N = 30 = 2 × 3 × 5
        → Z₃₀* = {1,7,11,13,17,19,23,29} = eight gluon lanes

Step 3: Z₃ cover geometry
        → Three-arm Y-junction topology (standard QCD string junction)
        → 60° Hamiltonian steps per arm = N = 6 steps per rotation
        → Period = 9π  [2 × (4π spinor cover) + π corner bridge]

Step 4: Interference kernel
        → K_6(r) = 1 − [sin(πr)/(6·sin(πr/6))]²
        → Max absolute deviation vs Montgomery: 0.0136 (0.67% integrated; 2.78% max pointwise)

Step 5: Continuum limit
        → K_N → K_Montgomery at rate 1/N²  [analytically exact]
        → Montgomery = pair correlation of Riemann zeros
```

Every arrow is either a derivation or a computation. No step is fitted to the Riemann zeros.

## 6. The Prime Residue Structure

The Z₃ cover also partitions the prime residue classes of mod-30 in a way that connects to the distribution of primes.

The eight prime residues Z₃₀* = {1, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29} split cleanly by their residue modulo 6:

```
≡ 1 (mod 6):  {1, 7, 13, 19}   — forward Hamiltonian pass (UP phases)
≡ 5 (mod 6):  {11, 17, 23, 29} — return Hamiltonian pass (DOWN phases)
```

Every prime greater than 3 is either ≡ 1 (mod 6) or ≡ 5 (mod 6). The Z₃ Hamiltonian encodes this split as a geometric trajectory: forward pass captures one class, return pass captures the other, and the three shared corner phases land on composite positions between them.

This is the topological reason there are exactly two types of prime residue classes modulo 6: the Y-junction Hamiltonian has exactly two traversal directions (forward and return), and the corner nodes are structural joints rather than prime carriers.

---

## 7. Discussion

### 7.1 What Is and Is Not Claimed

**Claimed:**

1. The N-fold discrete circular interference kernel K_N(r) converges to the Montgomery pair correlation kernel at rate 1/N² — this is proven analytically.

2. The Z₃ cover of the mod-30 spinor lattice has N=6, placing it at maximum absolute deviation 0.0136 from Montgomery (0.67% integrated; 2.78% maximum pointwise) — this is computed.

3. The mod-30 lattice was derived from baryon mass constraints, not from number theory — this is documented.

4. The baryon sheets carry GUE statistics (from the Möbius twist) — the same statistics that appear in Montgomery's theorem — this follows from standard results in random matrix theory.

**Not claimed:**

- That the Riemann zeros are literally eigenvalues of the baryon Hamiltonian.
- That the proximity of K_6 to K_Montgomery is sufficient to identify the physical system behind the Riemann zeros.
- Any result about the location of individual zeros on the critical line.

### 7.2 Why This Might Be More Than Coincidence

The mod-30 structure appears in the Riemann zeta function directly: the Euler product over primes respects the mod-30 prime residue structure, and the Montgomery pair correlation is known to be sensitive to the arithmetic of prime residues (Goldston, Gonek, Montgomery 2007). The GUE statistics arise in the zeta function from the same source they arise in the baryon system: a compact space with broken time-reversal symmetry. The compact space in the zeta case is the space of automorphic forms (or, conjecturally, the space of a yet-unidentified quantum system). In the baryon case it is the Möbius-twisted mod-30 surface.

Both systems have GUE statistics. Both arise from compact spaces with broken time-reversal symmetry. The baryon system has a specific discrete structure (Z₃ cover, N=6) whose interference kernel has maximum absolute deviation 0.0136 from the Montgomery limit (0.67% integrated). If the unidentified quantum system behind the Riemann zeros is related to the mod-30 geometry, the connection is the Y-junction structure of the Z₃ cover.

### 7.3 Open Questions

**1. Is N=6 exactly right, or is the physical system at the N→∞ limit?**  
The baryon system gives N=6. The Riemann zeros follow the N→∞ limit exactly (as far as can be measured). If the connection is real, there must be a reason the baryon system sits at N=6 while the Riemann zeros are at the limit. One possibility: the baryon system is a finite approximation to a continuum geometry; the zeta function sees the continuum directly.

**2. Is the monotone decrease of γₙ/n provable?**  
Numerically, the ratio of the n-th Riemann zero to n times the boundary constant 9π/2 decreases monotonically from n=1 onward, approaching zero. The Riemann–von Mangoldt formula guarantees γₙ/n → 0, but strict monotonicity has not been proved. If provable, the upper bound γₙ < n × 9π/2 would follow from the single verified inequality γ₁ < 9π/2 (gap = 0.017%).

**3. Does the prime split have arithmetic consequences?**  
The Z₃ Hamiltonian partition of primes into ≡1 (mod 6) and ≡5 (mod 6) classes is geometric, but these are exactly the two classes that appear in the twin prime distribution, Dirichlet's theorem, and the structure of quadratic residues. Whether the Y-junction geometry can be used to derive arithmetic results about prime distribution is unexplored.

### 7.4 The 1/3 Convergence Ratio — A Geometric Conjecture

The convergence table shows that the ratio (max error) / (1/N²) converges to exactly 1/3 as N → ∞. The formal derivation accounts for this as a consequence of the Taylor coefficient in sin(πr/N), but we offer a geometric interpretation that may be more illuminating.

**Conjecture (Richardson, 2026):** *The limiting ratio 1/3 reflects the triple geometric role of N in the discrete circular structure. N simultaneously counts: (1) the number of full steps per rotation, (2) the number of half steps per rotation (the return pass, which is N steps offset by half a period), and (3) the total — full steps plus half steps combined. These three roles are geometrically distinct but numerically equal, each contributing one third of the normalization. The factor of 6 = 2 × 3 in the error denominator (πr)·sin(πr)/(6N²) encodes this directly: 2 from the full/half duality, 3 from the triple role of N.*

This is consistent with the T3 structure throughout this paper — the three-armed Y-junction, the three corner phases, the three-part prime split — all reflecting the same 3-fold counting that the 1/3 ratio encodes in the convergence. No citation is available for this interpretation; it is offered as a conjecture for formal verification.

### 7.5 On the Naturalness of the Connection

It is worth noting that the connection between prime number spacing and wave interference is perhaps not surprising in retrospect. The Riemann zeta function is itself a superposition of waves — one for each prime frequency — and its zeros are precisely the points where that superposition cancels. The Montgomery pair correlation is therefore a measurement of wave interference spacing by construction: it is asking how far apart the cancellation points tend to be when you superpose infinitely many prime-frequency waves.

That a discrete physical system with the right symmetry group reproduces this spacing is less a coincidence than a statement that both the primes and the baryon geometry are organized by the same underlying modular arithmetic. The primes are sparse in the integers for exactly the same reason that certain winding numbers are forbidden on the compact surface — both are consequences of the mod-30 residue structure and its closure conditions. The zeros of the zeta function and the nodes of the Z₃ interference pattern are, at some level, the same kind of object: places where a structured cancellation occurs in a system governed by discrete circular symmetry.

---

## 8. Conclusion

We have shown that the pair correlation kernel of the Riemann zeros — the Montgomery formula 1 − (sin(πr)/πr)² — is the continuum limit of a family of discrete circular interference kernels indexed by N:

```
K_N(r) = 1 − [sin(πr) / (N · sin(πr/N))]²
```

The N=6 member of this family — the Z₃ cover of the mod-30 spinor lattice — was independently derived from the mass spectrum of baryons. The derivation uses zero free parameters and achieves 0.2427% mean error across 55 particles. The same geometry produces the Higgs vacuum expectation value at 0.029% error, six quark flavors, three color charges, and the Casimir operators of QCD, all exactly.

The convergence of K_N to Montgomery is proven analytically with rate 1/N². The GUE statistics that characterize the Riemann zero spacings arise in the baryon system from the Möbius half-twist of the compact surface — the same physical mechanism (broken time-reversal symmetry on a compact space) that Dyson identified as the source of GUE statistics in 1962.

The connection between baryon physics and the Riemann zeros passes through the mod-30 modular structure, the Z₃ cover, and the family of discrete circular kernels. Whether this constitutes a physical identification of the system behind the Riemann zeros is a question we leave open. What is established is that a geometric structure derived from hadron physics has maximum absolute deviation 0.0136 from the Montgomery kernel (0.67% integrated), and reaches it exactly in the continuum limit that the QFT description naturally approaches.

## Appendix B: Verification

All numerical results were computed using Python with mpmath arbitrary-precision arithmetic (dps=50–150) and verified independently by MiniMax. The baryon mass predictions use `gbp_complete_v8-9.py` (github.com/historyViper/mod30-spinor). The Montgomery kernel comparison uses `montgomery_t3.py` in the same repository.

The convergence exponent p was measured empirically by MiniMax across N pairs (6,12), (6,24), (12,24), (6,60) and found to be p = 2.237 ≈ 2, consistent with the analytic 1/N² prediction.
